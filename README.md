Flyweight Pattern in Java, one of the Structural Design Patterns
The Flyweight Pattern is used to reduce memory usage or improve performance by sharing common state between multiple objects.

Instead of creating a large number of similar objects, the Flyweight pattern shares immutable, intrinsic data and separates extrinsic data (context-dependent data) that can vary between instances.
